# Release Troubleshooting

Common issues and recovery steps.

## Partial Failures

### Commit succeeded but push failed

```bash
# Push the commit and tag manually
git push origin main --tags
```

### Push succeeded but GitHub release failed

```bash
# Create release for existing tag
gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes "Release notes here"

# Or with notes from file
gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes-file CHANGELOG.md
```

### Tag exists but no release

```bash
# Create release for existing tag
gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z" --generate-notes
```

## Undoing a Release

### Delete a tag (not yet pushed)

```bash
git tag -d vX.Y.Z
```

### Delete a pushed tag

```bash
# Delete locally
git tag -d vX.Y.Z

# Delete from remote
git push origin :refs/tags/vX.Y.Z
```

### Delete a GitHub release

```bash
# Delete release (keeps tag)
gh release delete vX.Y.Z --yes

# Delete release and tag
gh release delete vX.Y.Z --yes --cleanup-tag
```

### Revert release commit

```bash
# If commit not pushed yet
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# If already pushed, create revert commit
git revert HEAD
git push
```

## Common Errors

### "fatal: tag 'vX.Y.Z' already exists"

A tag with this version already exists.

```bash
# Check existing tags
git tag --list 'v*'

# Use a different version, or delete existing tag
git tag -d vX.Y.Z
```

### "error: failed to push some refs"

Usually means the remote has commits you don't have locally.

```bash
# Fetch and check
git fetch origin
git log HEAD..origin/main --oneline

# If safe to force (only if you're the only contributor)
git push origin main --tags --force
```

### "gh: Not Found (HTTP 404)"

Repository not found or no permission.

```bash
# Check auth status
gh auth status

# Re-authenticate if needed
gh auth login
```

### "error: pathspec 'CHANGELOG.md' did not match any files"

Changelog file doesn't exist or wasn't staged.

```bash
# Check file exists
ls CHANGELOG.md

# Manually add and commit
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit --amend
```

### CHANGELOG.md ignored by .gitignore

On case-insensitive filesystems (macOS), patterns like `changelog.md` will block `CHANGELOG.md`.

```bash
# Check if CHANGELOG.md is ignored
git check-ignore CHANGELOG.md

# If ignored, find the pattern
git check-ignore -v CHANGELOG.md

# Remove the pattern from .gitignore, then retry
```

### Rate limiting

GitHub API rate limits hit.

```bash
# Check rate limit status
gh api rate_limit

# Wait and retry, or use --skip-ci to reduce API calls
```

## Worktree Issues

### "fatal: 'main' is already checked out"

Can't create worktree because branch is checked out elsewhere.

```bash
# List worktrees
git worktree list

# Use --detach to checkout without branch
git worktree add /tmp/release origin/main --detach
```

### Ephemeral worktree not cleaned up

```bash
# List worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove stale worktrees
git worktree prune

# Force remove specific worktree
git worktree remove /tmp/release-XXXXX --force
```

## CI Issues

### CI failing on default branch

Fix the CI issue before releasing, or use `--skip-ci` if you're confident the release is safe.

```bash
# Check recent CI runs
gh run list --limit 5

# View specific run
gh run view <run-id>

# Release anyway (use with caution)
bun release.ts --skip-ci
```

### CI pending for too long

```bash
# Check run status
gh run list --limit 1

# Cancel stuck run
gh run cancel <run-id>

# Release with skip
bun release.ts --skip-ci
```

## Version Conflicts

### Wrong version released

1. Delete the release and tag
2. Fix CHANGELOG.md
3. Create new release with correct version

```bash
gh release delete vX.Y.Z --yes --cleanup-tag
git reset --soft HEAD~1  # if changelog commit not pushed
# Edit CHANGELOG.md
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "release: vX.Y.Z (corrected)"
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin main --tags
gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes "..."
```

### Need to re-release same version

Not recommended. Better to bump patch and explain in notes.

```bash
# If you must re-release same version:
gh release delete vX.Y.Z --yes --cleanup-tag
git tag -d vX.Y.Z
git push origin :refs/tags/vX.Y.Z
# Then release again
```
