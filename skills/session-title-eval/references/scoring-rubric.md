# Session Title Scoring Rubric

## Criteria

A good session title should be:

1. **Specific** - Captures the actual task being worked on
2. **Actionable** - Uses active voice ("Fix X", "Add Y", "Debug Z")
3. **Concise** - 4-7 words, scannable at a glance
4. **No meta-language** - Avoids "user wants", "working on", "session about"

## Score Definitions

### Score 5 - Perfect

The title:
- Precisely captures what was done
- Uses active voice
- Is 4-7 words
- Contains no meta-language
- Would help you instantly recall the session

**Examples:**
- "Fix OAuth redirect loop"
- "Add rate limiting to API"
- "Debug flaky CI tests"

### Score 4 - Good

Minor issues like:
- Slightly too long (8-10 words)
- Missing one detail from multi-topic session
- Slightly generic but still useful

**Examples:**
- "Fix authentication issues in login flow" (bit long)
- "Update auth module" (could be more specific)

### Score 3 - Acceptable

Gets the general idea but lacks specificity:
- Too broad to distinguish from similar sessions
- Missing key context
- Functional but not memorable

**Examples:**
- "Auth fixes"
- "API improvements"
- "Bug fixes"

### Score 2 - Poor

Significant issues:
- Too vague to be useful
- Contains meta-language
- Wrong focus (mentions tangential detail)
- Too long and rambling

**Examples:**
- "Working on code"
- "User wants to fix something"
- "Session about updating various files"

### Score 1 - Bad

Completely unhelpful:
- Error messages as titles
- Timestamps only
- Completely wrong topic
- Gibberish or truncated

**Examples:**
- "Session 10:30 AM"
- "Invalid API key"
- "Prompt is too long"
- "undefined"

## Judging Tips

When scoring, ask yourself:
1. Would this title help me find this session later?
2. Does it tell me WHAT was done, not just WHERE?
3. Could I distinguish this from other similar sessions?
4. Is it scannable in a list of 20+ sessions?
