# Roadmap

## Direction

**Current focus**: Chronicle continuity and intelligence features

### Active
- Chronicle Phase 2: Stale detection (pending item aging, resolution signals)
- Chronicle Phase 3: Smart suggestions (session-start context injection)

### Planned
- Chronicle Phase 4: Cross-project intelligence
- Thread identity across sessions

### Deferred
- Hooks validation system
- Video generation skill

## Learnings

### 2026-01-22 — Chronicle catchup command (#56)
- Brainstorm-to-brief workflow effective for going wide then narrowing
- Conductor workspace sandbox requires using Bash for writes outside workspace
- SKILL.md serves as both documentation AND command dispatcher
- Worktree detection reuses patterns from extract-lib.ts
- Pending deduplication by normalizing text (lowercase, trim)
