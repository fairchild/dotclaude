# Roadmap

## Direction

**Chronicle**: Build a personal memory system for coding sessions
- Sync session data between machines
- Surface pending threads and continuity insights
- Track patterns to improve future sessions

**Skills**: Refine the superpowers skill framework
- Create reusable, composable skills
- Build skills that learn from feedback

## Learnings

### 2026-01-24 — Chronicle Sync UX Simplification (#59)
- macOS osascript dialogs are plain text only—rich UI needs native app
- Structured output (JSON) is UI-agnostic—design for any consumer
- Terminal preview + dashboard covers 90% of use cases without native UI
- Feedback loops require click tracking—defer until native UI exists
