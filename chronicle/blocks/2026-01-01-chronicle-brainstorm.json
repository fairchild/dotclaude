  "project": "dotclaude",
  "branch": "feat/chronicle-brainstorm",
  "summary": "Designed and built The Chronicle MVP - a persistent journalist agent with curator subagent for intelligent memory management.",
  "goal": "Create a system that remembers coding sessions, tracks pending work, and learns patterns over time",
  "accomplished": [
    "Researched Letta framework (memory blocks, sleep-time compute, self-hosting)",
    "Designed three-tier memory architecture (hot/warm/cold)",
    "Defined MVP: Continuity Threads for tracking pending work",
    "Created pattern mining and preference learning designs",
    "Built /chronicle skill with quick capture and curate modes",
    "Created chronicle-curator subagent for intelligent memory curation",
    "Committed design doc (1127 lines) to skills/chronicle/docs/",
    "Created first memory block - Chronicle is bootstrapping itself"
  ],
  "pending": [
    "Test /chronicle in new session (skill/agent discovery requires restart)",
    "Implement Stop hook for automatic thread extraction",
    "Backfill from last 30 days of history.jsonl"
  ],
  "challenges": [
    "Skill and agent discovery require session restart - can't test live"
  ],
  "nextSteps": [
    "Start new session to test /chronicle command",
    "Use /chronicle curate daily to build intuition",
    "Merge feat/chronicle-brainstorm to main once validated"
  ],
  "notes": "First Chronicle block, updated by manual curator run. The /chronicle pending command is now part of the skill spec - marking as done. The system is learning to track itself!"
