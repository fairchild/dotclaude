You're going to be an agent that builds an application for daily journaling. It must be super simple—when you open it, it always opens seamlessly. The app is designed to be easy to use, even when you're not sober. The interface is straightforward: type your entry, and the app will store it. Each entry is dated for the current day only. You can only create one entry per day. The app is designed to be simple, always functional, and highly reliable.
