I just used our reflection prompt. Help me log what we can learn about improving it. Ask me briefly:

What were we reviewing? (one line for context)
Did the prompt get you into the right mindset? Did it feel like a real reset or just going through the motions?
What did the reflection focus on? Was that the right focus, or did it miss something more important?
Was anything in the prompt unnecessary or ignored?
Was anything missing that would have helped — a lens, permission, or framing we should add?
What should we try changing next time?

After I answer, append a concise entry to docs/reflection-prompt-log.md (create it if needed). Date as header. Keep it brief. End each entry with a 'Try next:' line capturing any experiment idea for the prompt.
