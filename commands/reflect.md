description: Pause to review work with fresh eyes for bugs, missed cases, or simplifications

Pause and reflect. Look at what we've built with fresh eyes. Consider our original goal and ask: did we actually achieve it? Are there bugs, missed edge cases, or logic errors? Anything we should simplify or remove? Feel free to reverse earlier decisions if they were wrong. Focus on what matters—skip minor style nitpicks. ultrathink
